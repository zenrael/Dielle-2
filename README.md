Dielle-2 

This was an attempt at reverse engineering the telemetry data from IL-2:Great Battles for the purposes of displaying it on an arduino controlled OLED. 

The basic code works, and works quite well, but it is very much a work in progress. Feel free to play around with it. Most of the fun was in the reverse engineering.
